Howdy Farmer! My name is Jo Miner and welcome to Gamer Time Farms. 
Here at gamer time farms you will learn to grow our special crops.

You see our plants are a little bit different 'round these parts.
HAha like computer parts. You see, we grow computers with USBs!

I would like to think that we are really plugged into the argiculture industry.
Get it, PLUGGED IN?!?!? hAHA.

Anywho, to get started, let's go buy your first PCeeds!
Click on your house to access your very own computer.

*Loads first into computer*

Oh sheesh, it seems our computer is a bit buggy. Click on that red X to
see your lovely home. 

*Home*
Perfect, here you can see that all you really need to get by is a good 'ol
personal computer. Also known as a PC! How neat!

Anyways, continue back to your friend the PC by clicking on the screen of it. 

*in screen*
Now that we are here, I have lent you 5 Bitcoins to get started. Haha you're so rich!
Use your load of coinage to purchase the Red USB PCeed.

Lovely, you can tell that you have purchase the PCeed because your'e broke. 
Let's go plant that seed!

To leave the Personal computer, click on the red X just like earlier!

*in house* 
Now to leave your home, click on the back arrow.

*outside* 
We have made it back outside! Click on the red plot three times to grow the plant.

Now it is full grown. Click on the red computer plant to sell your first PCeed plant.
Now this is what we call a CP, a computer plant! Haha. 

Congratulations. I think you've got the hang of it. Keep growing up your farm 
and maybe you'll find the legendary RGB PCeed! Who knows where that could be, haha.
